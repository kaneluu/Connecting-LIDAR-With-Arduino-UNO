# Steps-Arduino-and-LCD-Connection-without-Potentiometer
I. Parts Needed:
_Hardware: Arduino UNO, LIDAR Lite v3, jumper wires.
_Software: Arduino IDE.
II. LIDAR Lite Introduction:
_LIDAR Lite is an easily useful sensor for beginners who have an interest in learning and getting used to using it.
_It has six pins attached with wires. The red wire is always the 5v input power wire and the black is the ground.
_The other four pins including SDA (Serial Data), SCL (Serial Clock), MODE, and PWR EN.
III. Arduino and LIDAR connection
_Ground wire to Ground pin on Arduino
_5v wire to 5v pin on Arduino
_SDA to A4/Analog 4 on Arduino
_SCL to A5/Analog 5 on Arduino
